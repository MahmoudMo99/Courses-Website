        <h1> Programming Concept </h1>
       <h3>
- Programming is the process of writing instructions and directing commands to a computer or any other device such as DVD readers
<br> or audio and video receivers in modern communication systems, 
 to direct this device and inform it how to deal with data or how to perform a series of required actions called an algorithm .
       </h3>
       <h1>A brief history of programming</h1>
           <h3>
- Programmable devices have been around since at least 1206 AD . 
<br>- However, the first computer program dates back to 1843 .
<br>- In the 1880s, Hermann Hollerith invented the concept of storing data in a machine-readable form .
<br>- Machine code was the language of early software and was written in the instruction set of a given machine, often in binary encoding .
<br>- Soon, assembly languages were developed that allow the programmer to specify instructions in text format .
<br>- High-level programming languages have made the program development process simpler and more understandable .
<br>- The Fortran programming language was the first widely used high-level language for practical implementation in 1957 .
           </h3>
           <h1>Programming Languages</h1>
           <h3>
- It is worth mentioning here the meaning of the word language, which is the method of communication and understanding between people,
<br> or, in the case of a computer, the way a computer understands a person's request.
<br>- Therefore, the programmer must be familiar with some programming languages and know what is the appropriate language to implement this program.
<br>- The only programming language that a computer understands and can handle is machine language.
 <h2> Some of Programming Languages : </h2>
 <h3> C , C++ , Java , Java-Script , Python , C# , PHP</h3>
